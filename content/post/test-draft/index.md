# Please stop looking at my Github drafts! Creep!

I'm going to take part in [100 days to offload](https://100daystooffload.com/) within the next year. I'm not sure if I will be able to follow through, but I'm going to make use of this reset. If you read my last post you would know that I lost a fair amount of data, and I still have a lot of work to do to get back where I was. I've been meaning to blog more, and I think this is a good chance. I'm going to try and document everything I'm doing. This may end up being messy, but if I can manage to keep up, hopefully by the end I will have improved my writing/blogging skills.  
This blog is fairly more complex than it used to be, it used to be a plain [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) folder, and I'd update it through vim. This is using GitHub pages (Yes, I know that GitHub is bad, but I need to look for a better solution) and it is deploying automatically. It is a nice system that let's me type in a fancy editor (like [ghostwriter](https://github.com/KDE/ghostwriter)) and then deploy through git and have my page automatically updated. This setup may change, but I think I'm going to try and keep it from getting out of hand like it used to where it was un-git-syncable with all of my large files that I placed in my public folder. This article is being written late in the evening on the 2nd of March, and I think this is the date that I will count my start date because I've already published a post today. Hopefully it will be edited on the 3rd and also published.
